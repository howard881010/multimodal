Hi MY IBD SIGN OUT My Products My Favorites My Stock Lists Edit Favorites Sign In or Subscribe Stock Market Today Dow Jones Futures: Stock Market Rallies On \\'Nimble\\' Fed, But Must Do This; SNOW Stock Crashes Licensing ED CARSON 08:23 AM ET 03/03/2022 Dow Jones futures turned slightly higher Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as crude oil price continue to run higher. The stock market rally attempt showed strong gains Wednesday. Fed chief Jerome Powell vowed to be \"nimble\" with rate hikes, while a possible new round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks also helped. ↑ X Stocks Reverse Lower From Resistance: Union Pacific, Anthem Near Buy Points; Datadog In Doghouse See All Videos NOW PLAYING Stocks Reverse Lower From Resistance: Union Pacific, Anthem Near Buy Points; Datadog In Doghouse SNOW stock crashed overnight. Richly valued, unprofitable cloud-based data warehouse company Snowflake (SNOW) beat views, but revenue growth is slowing while its fiscal 2023 guidance was not good enough to satisfy investors. On Feb. 10-11, Snowflake stock tried to move above its 50-day line, but was turned away. Now SNOW stock could test its May 2021 post-IPO low. Micron Technology (MU) and Rambus (RMBS) flashed early buy signals in Wednesday\\'s session, while Axcelis Technologies (ACLS) is on the verge of doing so. Other chip plays close to being actionable include Alpha & Omega Semiconductor (AOSL) and Broadcom (AVGO), which reports earnings late Thursday. Meanwhile, Apple stock rose solidly, moving toward its 50-day line and various buy points. Apple (AAPL) on Wednesday announced a March 8 product event, with a lower-cost 5G iPhone among the expected offerings. Fed chief Powell told Congress he still favors a March rate hike but promised to \"be nimble\" amid \"highly uncertain\" economic impacts from the Ukraine crisis. Powell also said he backs a quarter-point move at the March 15-16 Fed meeting, seeming to take a half-point hike off the table. Russia and Ukraine are scheduled to resume peace talks, but neither side seems poised to settle. Russia continues to expand its Ukraine invasion, while indiscriminate bombing is increasing civilian deaths in major cities. Fuel, food and other logistics remain a major problem for Russia\\'s invasion force, according to U.S. defense officials. Russian troops and equipment appear to have suffered significant losses, in no small part because of logistics shortcomings. MU stock is on IBD Leaderboard. Alpha & Omega and ACLS stock are on the IBD 50 list. Micron and AOSL stock were IBD Stock Of The Day selections this week. The video embedded in this article discusses today\\'s strong market price gains while also analyzing Oneok (OKE), Mosaic (MOS) and Micron stock. Dow Jones Futures Today Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.12%. Nasdaq 100 futures just edged higher. While SNOW stock is NYSE-listed, its overnight meltdown triggered losses in a number of other highly valued software stocks, including Bill.com (BILL) and Datadog (DDOG). U.S. crude oil futures rose almost 3% to nearly $113 a barrel. There is growing sentiment to cut off Russian energy imports in the U.S. and Europe, though that would send prices even higher. Wheat futures continued to soar. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn\\'t necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session. Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live Stock Market Rally The stock market rally once again started with modest moves but got rolling, this time to the upside. Fed chief Powell, stressing flexibility and modest policy moves amid hot inflation and Ukraine war uncertainty, helped buoy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8% in Wednesday\\'s stock market trading. The S&P 500 index popped 1.9%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 2.4%. Crude oil prices rose nearly 7% to $110.60 a barrel, hitting $112.51 intraday. That\\'s it\\'s highest level since 2011. Russia is having trouble finding buyers or shippers for its crude oil and other commodities, even at big discounts, raising global supply concerns. OPEC+ agreed to keep slowly unwinding pandemic-era production cuts. The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded 18 basis points to 1.865% after tumbling 12 basis points on Tuesday. ETFs Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) popped 2.7%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) ran up 3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) advanced 1.5%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) jumped 3.3%. Micron and AVGO stock are notable SMH holdings. SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) kept climbing, adding 3.8%. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) rose 3.3%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 1.7%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) gained 2.9%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) advanced 2.3% and the Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) 2.6%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) climbed 1.5%. Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) sank 1.1% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 1.45%. Five Best Chinese Stocks To Watch Now Chip Stocks In, Near Buy Zones Micron stock shot up 8.2% to 93.30 on Wednesday, rebounding back above its 50-day line in above-average volume. MU stock has a 96.60 cup-with-handle official buy point. But investors could have used the breaking of a short trendline within the handle as an early entry. The cup-with-handle pattern formed next to a much-longer cup-with-handle consolidation, which had a short-lived breakout in December. Rambus stock popped 5% to 28.01 on modestly higher volume. The chip technology firm ended just below a 28.32 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith. But investors could have bought RMBS stock as it rebounded from the 50-day line and broke a trendline starting from the Dec. 28 peak of 28.89. The relative strength line is already at a high while Rambus stock is still basing. That\\'s a bullish sign and marked by a blue dot at the end of the RS line. ACLS stock popped 7.3% to 71.59, also rebounding from the 50-day line. Investors could use 71.79, just above Monday\\'s high, as an early entry. The official buy point is 75.10 from a loose handle in a cup base. The RS line for ACLS stock is already at a new high. Axcelis makes specialized chip equipment such as ion implantation systems and high-energy implanters AOSL stock rose 4.6% to 53.39, moving off its 50-day line. Shares of the power-management-chip maker have a 59.48 entry. But investors could use a move above Tuesday\\'s high of 55.73 + 10 cents as an early entry. AVGO stock rose 2.75% to 585.78. Shares of the wireless-chip maker and software maker need to get above the 50-day line, with 614.74 a possible early entry. The official buy point for AVGO stock is 677.86. Broadcom earnings are due Thursday night. All of these chip names have relatively modest price-to-earnings ratios, a positive element in the current rate-rising environment. RMBS stock has the highest P-E ratio at 43, but that\\'s not extreme for a growth stock, especially one that\\'s expected to more than double profit in 2022. In addition to these names, a number of other chip plays are not far from being interesting, including Qualcomm (QCOM) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). Apple Stock Apple stock climbed 2.1% to 166.56, but stopped short at its 21-day line. Investors could view AAPL stock as having a double-bottom base with a 176.75 buy point. Investors could use a trendline from the early January all-time high to find slightly early entry modestly above the 50-day line. The RS line for Apple stock is just below record levels. Market Rally Analysis The stock market rally attempt had a strong move Wednesday, with big price gains on the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq. However, volume fell vs. Tuesday on both the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges. That means none of the indexes had a follow-through day to confirm the new rally. That may be for the best. The major indexes are all still below their 21-day moving averages, which has acted as a resistance level for most of 2022. Clearing that level decisively would seem like a bare minimum for investor confidence. Beyond the 21-day line, the major indexes still have their February highs as well as their 50-day and 200-day lines as key levels, not necessarily in that order. The Russell 2000 is back above its 21-day line, but the February peaks and the 50-day loom. The market remains extremely news-driven. The market direction can quickly shift up or down based on the latest headline. One positive: Sentiment is turning bearish. Just 29.9% of investment newsletters are bullish, below the pandemic crash low. Meanwhile, 34.5% are bearish. When bears outnumber bulls, it\\'s a strong sign that at least a short-term bottom looms, though not necessarily right away. Time The Market With IBD\\'s ETF Market Strategy What To Do Now The stock market rally attempt bounced back strongly from Tuesday\\'s sell-off, though on lighter volume. Investors could add slightly to their exposure, perhaps branching from the energy/commodity sectors that have performed well in 2022. Unlike in late January and early February, a decent number of stocks are setting up or flashing buy signals. While this article highlighted Micron stock and other chip plays, health insurers, cybersecurity, building products and shipping firms are also shaping up, along with some more energy, mining and metals plays. But until the major indexes reclaim their 21-day line and the market rally has a follow-through day, you should keep your exposure modest. The downside risks remain high. This is an important time to be working on your watchlists. Cast a wide net for stocks in bases with strong RS lines. Then focus on a select list of names that are actionable or nearly so that you see as potential big winners.

AAPL co-founder Steve Wozniak has described Bitcoin BTC/USD as the only cryptocurrency that’s “pure-gold mathematics.”What Happened: Wozniak made the comments about Bitcoin in an interview with Business Insider in March 2022, adding that many cryptocurrencies are untrustworthy and have a track record of being “rip-offs.”“There are so many cryptocurrencies that come out now; everybody has a way to create a new one, and you have a celebrity star with it,” Business Insider quoted Wozniak as saying.The tech entrepreneur in the interview also suggested that people often buy cryptocurrencies simply because they are blinded by the potential windfalls.See Also: How To Buy Bitcoin (BTC)Why It Matters: Wozniak has praised Bitcoin earlier too. In July 2021, he called it the “most amazing mathematical miracle” and said that the apex cryptocurrency was better than gold because of its verifiable digital scarcity.In an interview with Yahoo Finance in November last year, Wozniak said he expects the hard-to-trace nature of cryptocurrencies to be a potential hindrance to large-scale adoption.Wozniak had launched his own cryptocurrency called Efforce WOZX/USD in December 2020.Apple CEO Tim Cook disclosed in November last year that he personally owned cryptocurrencies, but the Cupertino-based company would not be investing in cryptocurrencies any time soon.Read Next: EXCLUSIVE: Sam Bankman-Fried Responds To Benzinga Over SEC 'Special Treatment' Conspiracy AllegationsThis article was originally published on March 7, 2022.Photo: Gage Skidmore on FlickrMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2024 Benzinga.com.

S&P 500 index has 291 stocks that are ranked ‘buy’ by analysts: Are they on your watchlist? Dip-buying is ultimately a part of healthy markets, and it will happen no matter what stock analysts say. Written by Bloomberg Updated: March 8, 2022 18:21 IST Follow Us Specifically, analysts are bullish on the index’s four heaviest-weighted companies. Bloomberg Opinion: U.S. stocks slumped the most in 17 months on Monday, but the “buy the dip” mentality isn’t dead in the U.S. — and stock analysts are part of the reason it’s likely to stick around awhile. Research on individual stocks is as bullish as it has been in two decades by some measures. It’s no wonder investors can’t kick their equities habit despite the largest ground war in Europe since World War II and energy prices that threaten to exacerbate the worst inflation in 40 years. Even as the S&P 500 Index fell 12% from its recent peak, investors are being told repeatedly that the majority of individual stocks have a bright future. From that vantage point, of course, every selloff will look like a buying opportunity. Of 10,814 analyst ratings on S&P 500 stocks, 58.4% are “buys,” up from 58.2% at the end of the year, before the market had begun to reflect the risk from Russia. While the stock market has pulled back, analysts have been seemingly slow to assimilate the geopolitical threats and have remained generally committed to the price targets their models spit out. Relative to falling prices, those price targets make the upside look rather attractive. But is it, or are these recommendations just changing way too slowly?Also ReadCanada’s Ontario province announces a hike in the minimum wage to support workersCanada stops foreign nationals from applying for a post-graduation work permit at a port of entryTrump’s Green Card Promise: American dream of foreign students to get US citizenship on the cards?Study in USA After 12th: Best ways to get a top SAT score for US universities On a company by company basis, 291 stocks look like solid buys, meaning they have a recommendation consensus from analysts of 4 or above (each sell is a 1, each hold a 3 and each buy a 5). That’s the highest in two decades. Of that group, 90 are rated 4.5 or above, also near the most in 20 years. Specifically, analysts are bullish on the index’s four heaviest-weighted companies. Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have consensus recommendations of 4.5, 4.85, 4.92 and 4.96, respectively. (No. 5 Tesla Inc. is in the bottom quintile of the index at 3.4, but the Elon Musk cult of personality more than makes up for the enthusiasm gap.) When analysts exhibit this much unchecked optimism, it’s not necessarily a good thing. “Buy” recommendations were ubiquitous in 1999 and the early 2000s, before the dot-com bubble fully deflated, and there are some obvious parallels in today’s market. Then, as now, years of juicy returns have conditioned investors to believe that staying bullish pays off. Any analyst who entered the workforce after 2010 (essentially anyone 34 or younger) will understandably have a rosy perspective on markets. Those who owned or recommended risky stocks in February 2020 weren’t all necessarily chastened by the experience. Instead of humility, what they internalized was the notion that all stock losses would be recovered in a matter of months — and that the market would only surge higher from there. The current situation is another test for the optimists. Inflation is running so rampant at 7.5% that the Federal Reserve will have to embark on a rate-increase cycle that could risk tipping the economy into recession. Even in a best-case scenario, rising interest rates will mean higher funding costs for companies, threatening the durability of some of the highest equity valuations in recent history. Certainly, investors can’t be blamed for trying to pick some winners, and that’s an area that stock analysts specialize in. Even if you think stock indexes are about to get crushed, what are you going to do? Park your money in cash and let inflation eat away purchasing power? With most companies having reported for the latest quarter, some 76% have delivered a positive earnings surprise. Some will withstand whatever the next year brings with Ukraine and the Fed — and inevitably, a handful will make for epic investments. Dip-buying is ultimately a part of healthy markets, and it will happen no matter what stock analysts say. But in this turbulent market, I worry about the false sense of assurance people get when they consult a report and decide that the war in Europe and other risks aren’t material because the company happens to be doing well. The incentives in sell-side analysis are well known: Brokerages profit from trades, and firms gets more trades when they recommend buying. Analysts also need access to company executives, and CEOs can stop answering the phone if they don’t like an analyst’s research. The current bullish calls add another layer of sanguineness. The past few weeks notwithstanding, the incredible bull market of the past decade has lulled investors into a sense of complacency, and analysts aren’t doing them any favors by blithely going along for the ride.

Owens comments Mac Studio with the new M1 Ultra chip will start at $3,999, the most expensive Mac with Apple silicon; tech giant also reveals first major sports-broadcasting deal with Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+ Apple is offering three color choices for its new iPhone SE. Apple Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement AAPL +0.45% GOOG +2.65% GOOGL +2.68% AMZN +0.41% DIS +0.22% SPX +0.39% DJIA -0.76% Apple Inc.’s first product event of 2022 featured a new premium Mac offering powered by Apple silicon, along with a refreshed iPhone SE and iPad Air, and the first move into broadcasting live sports by the most valuable company in the U.S. At a product event broadcast from Apple’s AAPL, +0.45% Cupertino, Calif., campus on Tuesday, Chief Executive Tim Cook announced a revved-up version of its M1 chips, called the M1 Ultra. Apple will debut the chip in a new Mac computer called Mac Studio, which will be aimed at professionals and start at $3,999 with the M1 Ultra, which would make it the most expensive Mac that comes with an Apple-designed chip. The M1 Ultra announcement “will extend the competitive narrative of Apple’s silicon capabilities,” Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers wrote. Apple’s top-of-the-line Mac has been the Mac Pro, which starts at $5,999 but has not been refreshed since Apple started its silicon effort in late 2020; Apple stated that the Mac Studio with M1 Ultra will be capable of speeds 90% faster than the Mac Pro. Hardware executive Johny Srouji said in Tuesday’s event that the Mac Pro is last in line for an upgrade, but “that is for another day.” Apple has seen a surge in Mac sales since moving to its own silicon late in 2020, and the M1 Ultra is the latest in a line of chips that also include the M1 Pro and M1 Max. The higher-end Mac Studio will have both an M1 Max and an M1 Ultra, though versions with just an M1 Max will cost less, starting at $1,999. “It’s remarkable to think about the profound impact Apple silicon is having on the Mac and our other products,” Chief Executive Tim Cook said during the presentation. The Mac Studio was introduced alongside a new high-tech Apple monitor called the Studio Display, a 27″ 5K Retina display that will start at $1,599 for typical U.S. consumers. Apple also revealed a refreshed keyboard, trackpad and mouse, which will cost $199, $149 and $99 respectively. At the starting prices, a full Mac Studio setup — with an M1 Ultra-powered Mac Studio, Studio Display and the new peripherals announced Tuesday — would cost roughly $6,000. The new iPhone SE will have Apple’s A15 Bionic chip, the same one that’s featured in the iPhone 13. The chip promises performance improvements as it speeds up processing and battery efficiency. Apple is also introducing 5G to the iPhone SE line for the first time, after bringing this connectivity to its main iPhone line back in late 2020. The iPhone SE is Apple’s lower-cost iPhone. The phone has a glass and aluminum design and a 4.7-inch display. It will come in three color options: midnight, starlight, and red. Unlike other iPhones, the iPhone SE will have a fingerprint sensor. The starting price is $429, a slight bump from the $399 starting price on the last iPhone SE, and preorders will kick off Friday. The device officially becomes available March 18. “Overall, with the A15 chip this smartphone will be the fastest and most powerful phone at these price points by a wide margin and we believe based on our initial supply chain checks should translate into 30 million+ iPhone units out of the gates for this product launch,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote. He highlighted Apple’s willingness to push ahead with new product launches at a time when the consumer electronics industry is dealing with supply constraints, a dynamic he saw as reflective of the smartphone giant’s “massive supply chain/production muscles.” The company also announced a new iPad Air model, which will feature the company’s M1 chip as well as the option for 5G connectivity. Apple is bringing a 12-megapixel camera to the front of the iPad Air, which will have a $599 starting price and feature 64GB and 256GB storage options. As with the iPhone SE, users will be able to preorder the device starting Friday before it becomes available March 18. Apple is also adding new green color options for its iPhone 13 and 13 Pro models. Additionally, Cook announced that Apple has secured broadcasting rights for Major League Baseball, though the professional baseball league is currently in a labor lockout that is expected to delay the beginning of the season. Big Tech companies have been trying to secure sports-broadcasting rights, with Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG, +2.65% GOOGL, +2.68% YouTube broadcasting select MLB games last season and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.41% broadcasting the National Football League’s Thursday Night Football offering last season. Apple was reportedly bidding for a package of weekday MLB games earlier this year, after The Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, +0.22% ESPN decided to not broadcast games on weekdays in a new deal with the league. ESPN is focusing on its Sunday Night Baseball offering, according to the reporting. Apple said in a news release that the games will be available without a subscription “for a limited time” in eight countries: the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea and the UK. The company plans to expand to other countries, and will launch a live show on weeknights called “MLB Big Inning” that will offer live coverage of MLB in the U.S., as well as a channel for subscribers in the U.S. and Canada that will offer game replays, commentary, highlights and other offerings. Apple shares rose during the event, but fell back after it ended, closing with a 1.2% decline at $157.44. The stock has gained 35.3% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.39% added 9.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.76%, which includes Apple as a component, increased 3.2%.

Hi MY IBD SIGN OUT My Products My Favorites My Stock Lists Edit Favorites Sign In or Subscribe Stock Market Today Dow Jones Futures: Stock Market Rallies On \\'Nimble\\' Fed, But Must Do This; SNOW Stock Crashes Licensing ED CARSON 08:23 AM ET 03/03/2022 Dow Jones futures turned slightly higher Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as crude oil price continue to run higher. The stock market rally attempt showed strong gains Wednesday. Fed chief Jerome Powell vowed to be \"nimble\" with rate hikes, while a possible new round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks also helped. ↑ X Stocks Reverse Lower From Resistance: Union Pacific, Anthem Near Buy Points; Datadog In Doghouse See All Videos NOW PLAYING Stocks Reverse Lower From Resistance: Union Pacific, Anthem Near Buy Points; Datadog In Doghouse SNOW stock crashed overnight. Richly valued, unprofitable cloud-based data warehouse company Snowflake (SNOW) beat views, but revenue growth is slowing while its fiscal 2023 guidance was not good enough to satisfy investors. On Feb. 10-11, Snowflake stock tried to move above its 50-day line, but was turned away. Now SNOW stock could test its May 2021 post-IPO low. Micron Technology (MU) and Rambus (RMBS) flashed early buy signals in Wednesday\\'s session, while Axcelis Technologies (ACLS) is on the verge of doing so. Other chip plays close to being actionable include Alpha & Omega Semiconductor (AOSL) and Broadcom (AVGO), which reports earnings late Thursday. Meanwhile, Apple stock rose solidly, moving toward its 50-day line and various buy points. Apple (AAPL) on Wednesday announced a March 8 product event, with a lower-cost 5G iPhone among the expected offerings. Fed chief Powell told Congress he still favors a March rate hike but promised to \"be nimble\" amid \"highly uncertain\" economic impacts from the Ukraine crisis. Powell also said he backs a quarter-point move at the March 15-16 Fed meeting, seeming to take a half-point hike off the table. Russia and Ukraine are scheduled to resume peace talks, but neither side seems poised to settle. Russia continues to expand its Ukraine invasion, while indiscriminate bombing is increasing civilian deaths in major cities. Fuel, food and other logistics remain a major problem for Russia\\'s invasion force, according to U.S. defense officials. Russian troops and equipment appear to have suffered significant losses, in no small part because of logistics shortcomings. MU stock is on IBD Leaderboard. Alpha & Omega and ACLS stock are on the IBD 50 list. Micron and AOSL stock were IBD Stock Of The Day selections this week. The video embedded in this article discusses today\\'s strong market price gains while also analyzing Oneok (OKE), Mosaic (MOS) and Micron stock. Dow Jones Futures Today Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.12%. Nasdaq 100 futures just edged higher. While SNOW stock is NYSE-listed, its overnight meltdown triggered losses in a number of other highly valued software stocks, including Bill.com (BILL) and Datadog (DDOG). U.S. crude oil futures rose almost 3% to nearly $113 a barrel. There is growing sentiment to cut off Russian energy imports in the U.S. and Europe, though that would send prices even higher. Wheat futures continued to soar. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn\\'t necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session. Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live Stock Market Rally The stock market rally once again started with modest moves but got rolling, this time to the upside. Fed chief Powell, stressing flexibility and modest policy moves amid hot inflation and Ukraine war uncertainty, helped buoy stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8% in Wednesday\\'s stock market trading. The S&P 500 index popped 1.9%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 2.4%. Crude oil prices rose nearly 7% to $110.60 a barrel, hitting $112.51 intraday. That\\'s it\\'s highest level since 2011. Russia is having trouble finding buyers or shippers for its crude oil and other commodities, even at big discounts, raising global supply concerns. OPEC+ agreed to keep slowly unwinding pandemic-era production cuts. The 10-year Treasury yield rebounded 18 basis points to 1.865% after tumbling 12 basis points on Tuesday. ETFs Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) popped 2.7%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) ran up 3%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) advanced 1.5%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) jumped 3.3%. Micron and AVGO stock are notable SMH holdings. SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) kept climbing, adding 3.8%. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) rose 3.3%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 1.7%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) gained 2.9%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) advanced 2.3% and the Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) 2.6%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) climbed 1.5%. Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) sank 1.1% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 1.45%. Five Best Chinese Stocks To Watch Now Chip Stocks In, Near Buy Zones Micron stock shot up 8.2% to 93.30 on Wednesday, rebounding back above its 50-day line in above-average volume. MU stock has a 96.60 cup-with-handle official buy point. But investors could have used the breaking of a short trendline within the handle as an early entry. The cup-with-handle pattern formed next to a much-longer cup-with-handle consolidation, which had a short-lived breakout in December. Rambus stock popped 5% to 28.01 on modestly higher volume. The chip technology firm ended just below a 28.32 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith. But investors could have bought RMBS stock as it rebounded from the 50-day line and broke a trendline starting from the Dec. 28 peak of 28.89. The relative strength line is already at a high while Rambus stock is still basing. That\\'s a bullish sign and marked by a blue dot at the end of the RS line. ACLS stock popped 7.3% to 71.59, also rebounding from the 50-day line. Investors could use 71.79, just above Monday\\'s high, as an early entry. The official buy point is 75.10 from a loose handle in a cup base. The RS line for ACLS stock is already at a new high. Axcelis makes specialized chip equipment such as ion implantation systems and high-energy implanters AOSL stock rose 4.6% to 53.39, moving off its 50-day line. Shares of the power-management-chip maker have a 59.48 entry. But investors could use a move above Tuesday\\'s high of 55.73 + 10 cents as an early entry. AVGO stock rose 2.75% to 585.78. Shares of the wireless-chip maker and software maker need to get above the 50-day line, with 614.74 a possible early entry. The official buy point for AVGO stock is 677.86. Broadcom earnings are due Thursday night. All of these chip names have relatively modest price-to-earnings ratios, a positive element in the current rate-rising environment. RMBS stock has the highest P-E ratio at 43, but that\\'s not extreme for a growth stock, especially one that\\'s expected to more than double profit in 2022. In addition to these names, a number of other chip plays are not far from being interesting, including Qualcomm (QCOM) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). Apple Stock Apple stock climbed 2.1% to 166.56, but stopped short at its 21-day line. Investors could view AAPL stock as having a double-bottom base with a 176.75 buy point. Investors could use a trendline from the early January all-time high to find slightly early entry modestly above the 50-day line. The RS line for Apple stock is just below record levels. Market Rally Analysis The stock market rally attempt had a strong move Wednesday, with big price gains on the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq. However, volume fell vs. Tuesday on both the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges. That means none of the indexes had a follow-through day to confirm the new rally. That may be for the best. The major indexes are all still below their 21-day moving averages, which has acted as a resistance level for most of 2022. Clearing that level decisively would seem like a bare minimum for investor confidence. Beyond the 21-day line, the major indexes still have their February highs as well as their 50-day and 200-day lines as key levels, not necessarily in that order. The Russell 2000 is back above its 21-day line, but the February peaks and the 50-day loom. The market remains extremely news-driven. The market direction can quickly shift up or down based on the latest headline. One positive: Sentiment is turning bearish. Just 29.9% of investment newsletters are bullish, below the pandemic crash low. Meanwhile, 34.5% are bearish. When bears outnumber bulls, it\\'s a strong sign that at least a short-term bottom looms, though not necessarily right away. Time The Market With IBD\\'s ETF Market Strategy What To Do Now The stock market rally attempt bounced back strongly from Tuesday\\'s sell-off, though on lighter volume. Investors could add slightly to their exposure, perhaps branching from the energy/commodity sectors that have performed well in 2022. Unlike in late January and early February, a decent number of stocks are setting up or flashing buy signals. While this article highlighted Micron stock and other chip plays, health insurers, cybersecurity, building products and shipping firms are also shaping up, along with some more energy, mining and metals plays. But until the major indexes reclaim their 21-day line and the market rally has a follow-through day, you should keep your exposure modest. The downside risks remain high. This is an important time to be working on your watchlists. Cast a wide net for stocks in bases with strong RS lines. Then focus on a select list of names that are actionable or nearly so that you see as potential big winners.
