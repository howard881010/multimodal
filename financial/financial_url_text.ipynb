Learn More 3 Stocks to Invest $30,000 in Right Now By Dani Cook – Apr 27, 2024 at 1:20PM Key Points AMD has come a long way in the last ten years but could fly even higher over the next decade. Meanwhile, Amazon has a lucrative hold on the e-commerce market while investing heavily in AI. Additionally, Apple is revamping its product lineup to prioritize its AI capabilities. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AMD Advanced Micro Devices Market Cap $259B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-4.49%) -$7.53 Current Price $160.34 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET $10,000 to each of these companies could deliver major returns over the next decade. Tech stocks have a long reputation for providing consistent and significant gains over the long term, proven by the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector's 395% rise over the last 10 years. The industry's ever-expanding nature is driven by reliable demand for upgrades to various hardware and software products. So, it's unsurprising that investing mogul Warren Buffett's holdings company, Berkshire Hathaway, has dedicated more than 40% of its portfolio to tech stocks. Meanwhile, Berkshire's holdings posted a compound annual gain of nearly 20% between 1965 and 2023. As a result, it could be worth following suit and making a sizable long-term investment in the high-growth sector. So, here are three stocks to invest $30,000 in right now -- $10,000 for each. 1. Advanced Micro Devices Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -4.49%) business has exploded over the last decade, taking on a leading role in the chip market. A decade ago, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy, bleeding money alongside mounting debt. Then, in 2014, Lisa Su became AMD's CEO, triggering one of the most impressive turnarounds in the tech market's history. The launch of its Ryzen line of central processing units (CPUs) in 2017 has been a major growth catalyst, with AMD's CPU market share rising from 18% in the first quarter of 2017 to 33% in 2024. The company has gradually chipped away Intel's share, which fell from 82% to 64% in the same period. Data by YCharts Shares in AMD have soared 3,500% over the last 10 years. As a result, an investment of $10,000 in AMD's stock in 2014 would be worth more than $357 billion today. Of course, past growth doesn't always indicate what's to come. However, the company has an exciting outlook that could deliver major gains over the next 10 years. AMD is investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), launching new AI graphics processing units (GPUs) this year and investing in AI personal computers. The AI market hit nearly $200 billion last year and is projected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030. Alongside positions in other areas of tech, such as cloud computing, video games, and consumer PCs, AMD will likely continue benefiting from the tailwinds of tech for years. Consequently, an investment of $10,000 in AMD's stock over the next decade could deliver significant gains. 2. Amazon It's impossible to deny Amazon's (AMZN 1.50%) potent role in tech. Thanks to its popular e-commerce site, the company has built up immense brand loyalty worldwide. Amazon's retail site is available in over 20 countries and ships to more than 100 nations. The success of Amazon's e-commerce business has seen annual revenue climb 546% since 2014, with operating income skyrocketing by more than 20,000%. Amazon's meteoric rise is primarily owed to its lucrative Prime membership. Its subscription-based model bundles multiple services, including free expedited shipping on its retail site, video streaming, music, gaming, and more. Including multiple services makes consumers less likely to unsubscribe, leading to a global subscriber count above 230 million. Data by YCharts Shares in Amazon have risen 926% since 2014, meaning an investment of $10,000 back then would be worth over $102,000 today. And the company could potentially beat that growth over the next 10 years. In addition to consistent retail growth, Amazon is rapidly expanding in AI and cloud computing. On April 25, the company announced plans to invest $11 billion to build data centers in Indiana to grow Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company is on a promising growth path, and if you have the means, it could be worth an investment of $10,000 this month. However, a smaller investment is still worth considering. 3. Apple Apple (AAPL -1.92%) is easily one of the most successful companies in tech history. Its market cap of $2.6 billion makes it the world's second-most-valuable company (only after Microsoft). Meanwhile, Apple's vast and loyal user base has allowed it to achieve leading market shares in multiple product categories. However, the company has stumbled over the last year. Macroeconomic headwinds led to repeated quarters of revenue declines in 2023. Apple's Q1 2024 seemed to break the streak, with revenue rising 2% year over year. Meanwhile, the tech giant's free cash flow hit $107 billion, significantly more than Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet. The considerable difference could suggest Apple is best equipped to keep investing in its business and come back strong in the coming years. Data by YCharts Apple's stock has increased by 738% over the last decade. Consequently, a $10,000 investment in its shares 10 years ago would be worth nearly $84,000 today. Moreover, like AMD and Amazon, Apple is taking on AI head-on. Over the last year, the company has gradually added AI-driven features across its product range, with plans to overhaul its MacBook lineup to focus on AI. The company also recently acquired French AI company Datakalab, which specializes in on-device processing. Apple's dominating role in tech and exciting outlook could make it worth investing $10,000 in its stock, with plans to hold for at least a decade.

Learn More A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Bill Ackman Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Before It Surges 17%, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst By Adam Spatacco – Apr 27, 2024 at 11:26AM Key Points Bill Ackman is the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund with a large position in Alphabet stock. Alphabet is historically known to be an advertising conglomerate, but investments in AI are helping the company grow in many other areas. Alphabet stock looks like a bargain compared to its peers and historical valuation trends. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOOG Alphabet Market Cap $2,174B Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.50%) $0.88 Current Price $176.63 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET Bill Ackman\\'s only technology holding is a compelling buy on the heels of the AI revolution. One of the most closely followed investors on Wall Street is Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management. While Ackman\\'s portfolio has billions of dollars of investment capital, the hedge fund manager holds only seven individual stocks. Among this small cohort is just one technology company: \"Magnificent Seven\" member Alphabet (GOOG 0.50%) (GOOGL 0.43%). Earlier this month, Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer raised his price target on Alphabet stock to $185 -- implying roughly 17% to current trading levels as of market close on April 22. Let\\'s dig into why Ackman and others on Wall Street have strong convictions on Alphabet and assess whether now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares. Advertising is the cash cow, but... Alphabet\\'s core revenue and profit drivers come from advertising. Considering the company owns internet search website Google and video-sharing platform YouTube, it\\'s safe to say that Alphabet has an enormous presence online. The table below illustrates the growth trends in Alphabet\\'s ad business over the last several years. Category 2023 2022 2021 Google Search & other 8% 9% 43% YouTube ads 8% 1% 46% Google Network (4%) 3% 37% Total Google advertising 6% 7% 43% Data source: Alphabet investor relations In recent years, Alphabet has been forced to combat a number of competitors encroaching on its ad business. Meta Platforms owns a host of social media applications, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Moreover, the rising popularity of TikTok has also taken a toll on Alphabet\\'s appeal to advertisers. Nevertheless, even in the face of decelerating growth in its biggest business, Alphabet remains highly profitable. It\\'s this dynamic that I think investors are miscalculating. Sure, the advertising segment is witnessing an existential crisis. However, Alphabet\\'s robust operating margins are flowing down to the bottom line. And the company is making some savvy investments in new growth drivers that are already paying off. GOOGL Operating Income (Quarterly) data by YCharts. ...artificial intelligence (AI) is the new growth driver In addition to advertising, Alphabet has a services business and a cloud computing operation. The Services segment includes subscriptions to YouTube TV and NFL Sunday Ticket, purchases from the company\\'s app store, and sales from devices, such as the Google Pixel phone. Investors should be keen to know that the Services business is highly profitable -- generating $95.6 billion of operating income in 2023, up 16% year over year. Moreover, the cloud division is now consistently profitable. Last year, Alphabet\\'s cloud segment reported $1.7 billion in operating profit compared to a loss of $1.9 billion in 2022. One of the primary reasons Alphabet has been able to generate consistent, robust profitability metrics across so many different areas of its business is thanks to AI. In his 2023 shareholder letter, Ackman outlined that Alphabet\\'s \"competitive positioning in AI overshadowed the high-quality nature of its business and strong growth prospects.\" This is a nice way of alluding to some investors seeing better opportunities than Alphabet regarding AI. However, the trends explored above undermine Ackman\\'s position when it comes to Alphabet\\'s business model. As the company continues to integrate AI throughout its ecosystem, investors should begin to see an exponential jump in the company\\'s revenue and profit margin profiles across the many different areas in which Alphabet operates. Image source: Getty Images. Is now a good time to invest in Alphabet? As of the time of this article, Alphabet\\'s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.9 is the second-lowest among the Magnificent Seven -- narrowly above Apple. Moreover, the company\\'s price-to-free cash flow is essentially identical to Alphabet\\'s 10-year average. Considering how much Alphabet has grown over the last decade and how different the company is today compared to 10 years ago, I think investors may be steeply discounting future growth opportunities. GOOGL Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts. I think now is a lucrative chance to buy Alphabet on an underrated AI narrative. The stock looks dirt cheap relative to its peers, and with so much potential upside, it\\'s hard to pass on this one.

Learn More 1 Powerhouse Growth ETF I'm Buying and Holding Forever By Katie Brockman – Apr 27, 2024 at 11:15AM Key Points ETFs are low-effort investments that help build an instantly diversified portfolio. Growth ETFs carry more risk, but they're also designed to beat the market over time. By investing consistently, you could potentially earn hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSEMKT: VUG Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF Market Cap Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.30%) $1.10 Current Price $362.23 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET The right investment can supercharge your portfolio with minimal effort. When it comes to making money in the stock market, where you choose to buy will make or break your earnings potential. Investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a powerful way to build wealth with less effort than buying individual stocks. Each ETF contains dozens or hundreds of stocks, bundled together into a single investment. By investing in just one share of an ETF, you can build a well-diversified portfolio with a fraction of the effort. Growth ETFs, in particular, are designed to beat the market over time, as each fund contains stocks with the potential for above-average returns. While there are many growth ETFs to choose from, there's one I've owned for years and plan to continue buying for as long as possible: The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG 0.30%). Vanguard Growth ETF: The strengths The Vanguard Growth ETF contains just under 200 stocks from multiple industries, though around 56% of the fund is allocated to stocks in the tech sector. While the high percentage of tech stocks can increase your risk (since tech is generally more volatile than many other industries), this fund still offers plenty of diversification with stocks from nearly a dozen different sectors. This ETF also aims to balance risk and reward with its selection of blue chip stocks and smaller growth companies. The fund's top 10 holdings make up around half of its overall composition, and these stocks are from industry-leading juggernauts like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia. The rest of the stocks come from smaller corporations with more potential for growth. Balancing behemoth stocks with up-and-coming growth companies can help maximize your potential earnings while limiting risk. The bigger stocks are less likely to see explosive growth, but they're also generally safer than up-and-coming stocks. Smaller companies carry more risk, yet if any one of them turns into a superstar performer, you could see substantial returns. One potential weakness to consider Like all growth ETFs, this fund carries more risk than many other investments, particularly broad-market funds like an S&P 500 ETF or total market ETF. Growth stocks, in general, are more volatile than their more established counterparts. They often thrive when the market is surging, earning well-above-average returns. But when the market is volatile, they tend to be hit harder than more established stocks. If you're considering investing in any growth ETF, be sure you're willing to take on slightly higher levels of risk. While investing in ETFs can be less risky than buying individual stocks, growth funds are still more volatile than broad-market funds and many other types of ETFs. How much could you earn with this ETF? Past performance doesn't predict future returns, so it's impossible to say exactly how the Vanguard Growth ETF will perform over time. However, it can be helpful to look at its historical returns to see what type of future earnings may be possible. Over the past 10 years, this ETF has earned an average rate of return of 15.07% per year. If we look back to its inception in 2004, though, that average return drops to 11.18% per year -- which is still higher than the market's historic average of around 10% per year. Because growth ETFs can be more volatile and unpredictable than broad-market funds, let's assume your investment could earn either an 11%, 13%, or 15% average annual return going forward. If you were to invest, say, $200 per month, here's approximately how that would add up in each situation: Number of Years Total Portfolio Value: 11% Avg. Annual Return Total Portfolio Value: 13% Avg.

There are no guarantees that this ETF will see these types of returns going forward, and there's a chance it may not beat the market at all.

The Vanguard Growth ETF is a powerhouse investment that aims to balance risk and reward, and it has a strong track record of beating the market over time. If you're comfortable with higher levels of volatility in exchange for potentially higher returns, this ETF could be a fantastic fit for your portfolio.

Learn More The \"Magnificent Seven\" Day of Reckoning Has Arrived: Three Moves to Make Now By Daniel Foelber – Apr 27, 2024 at 8:10AM Key Points Now is the perfect time to do a portfolio review. You might find you are more exposed to certain themes than you thought. Owning stocks for the right reasons can make you a better investor. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: NVDA Nvidia Market Cap $300B Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.75%) $0.90 Current Price $121.79 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET The Nasdaq Composite just posted its worst week in 18 months. April 19 featured one of the most drastic tech-led sell-offs we\\'ve seen in a while, with Nvidia (NVDA 0.75%) falling 10% in a single session. All of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks got hit hard on Friday and led the Nasdaq Composite to fall 5.5% in a week. The Magnificent Seven is a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett and includes Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. Here are three moves you can make to brace for a prolonged market sell-off. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Double-check your exposure One of the most common mistakes investors make is to overly align themselves with a certain theme, sector, or type of stock. The easiest way for this to happen is that similar stocks go up more than the rest of your portfolio and then make up a larger percentage. This is exactly what has happened in the S&P 500, which is now comprised of 29.7% tech stocks. If you have held outperforming growth stocks for some time, your portfolio might have a higher allocation to growth than a few years ago. Another important factor to check is your exposure to stocks in exchange-traded funds and index funds. Every $100 invested in the S&P 500 is really about $30 in tech and $70 in the rest of the market. Out of every $100 invested in the Nasdaq Composite, over $40 goes into the Magnificent Seven. Many companies are also correlated to Magnificent Seven stocks. For example, if Nvidia gets hit hard, other chip stocks will also go down (precisely what played out during the April 19 sell-off). Understanding how your portfolio will likely perform in different situations can help you better manage your holdings and adjust your allocation with your investment objectives. 2. Revisit investment theses When volatility spikes, it\\'s easy to get more emotional about investing. One way to counter emotions, on both the upside and the downside, is to have a clearly defined investment thesis for each stock you own. It\\'s easier to let a winner run or have the patience to hold a stock when it sells off if you have clear expectations for a company. For example, a good reason for owning Microsoft is because of its rock-solid balance sheet, massive free cash flow generation, steadily growing dividend and buyback program, diversified business model, growing margins and sales, and its ability to invest in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud infrastructure, and other growth outlets without jeopardizing the strength of the business. In this vein, owning Microsoft isn\\'t just about what it does in the coming quarter or year, but how it is positioned to capitalize on megatrends and return value to shareholders. Of course, investors want to make sure the valuation doesn\\'t get out of hand, but it would take a seismic blunder for Microsoft\\'s investment thesis to derail. The most volatile Magnificent Seven stock is probably Nvidia, which collapsed 10% on April 19 and fell nearly 13.9% last week. ^IXIC data by YCharts. The harsh reality is that if a move like that scares you, it might be best not to own Nvidia at all -- which is perfectly OK. Growth stocks like Nvidia aren\\'t for everyone, and it takes a specific kind of risk tolerance to own them outright. For many investors, it might be better to get exposure to a company like Nvidia through an inexpensive fund like the Vanguard Growth ETF, where Nvidia is a top holding but is part of a diversified set of growth-focused stocks. 3. Regularly contribute to your portfolio Investors who regularly commit new savings to their portfolios could see the sell-off as a buying opportunity, especially now that valuations have become more attractive. It\\'s never a good feeling to have no inflows in your portfolio and be 100% invested in stocks so that you have to sell or reduce a position to buy something else. Contributing cash regularly to a portfolio, even a tiny amount, provides the dry powder needed to put capital to work during a sell-off without selling a stock at a big loss. The path forward Your approach to the sell-off in Magnificent Seven stocks will depend on your specific situation and portfolio needs. For example, if you go through a portfolio check and find out you already have plenty of exposure to the theme, you might want to do nothing. If you find out you own a stock for the wrong reasons after revisiting an investment thesis, you might want to consider what changes need to be made to get your portfolio back on track. If you are looking for more exposure to growth, you could allocate a higher percentage of new portfolio contributions to your favorite Magnificent Seven companies. Or you could instead consider ETFs that are concentrated in growth stocks. Most importantly, if you are a young investor or have a long time horizon, you will likely be a net buyer of stocks in the future, not a seller. In this position, sell-offs can actually work to your advantage. Understanding that long-term financial goals are far more important than how green or red your portfolio looks on a given day can help calm emotions and help you make grounded investment decisions, especially when there\\'s a lot of noise in the market.

Learn More 3 Top Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in This Bull Market By John Ballard, Jeremy Bowman, and Jennifer Saibil – Apr 27, 2024 at 8:00AM Key Points Berkshire\\'s massive investment in Apple speaks volumes about its long-term potential. The environment still seems ripe for homebuilder stocks, and Lennar looks poised to take advantage. Top AI stock Amazon gives Warren Buffett exposure to AI and other emerging opportunities. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,961B Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-1.92%) -$3.77 Current Price $193.12 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET Imitating the master can make you a better investor. Since bottoming out in 2022, the S&P 500 index has rocketed to new highs. While no one knows how long this run will last, history shows bull markets tend to last for longer stretches than when the market falls. Of course, Warren Buffett isn\\'t fazed by these ups and downs. He focuses on investments in solid companies that he believes will grow in value over many years. Berkshire Hathaway\\'s stock portfolio is full of outstanding businesses. Three Fool.com contributors recently selected their favorite stocks from Berkshire\\'s holdings. Here\\'s why they believe Apple (AAPL -1.92%), Lennar (LEN 0.91%), and Amazon (AMZN 1.50%) are solid buys right now. One of the strongest brands in the world John Ballard (Apple): Apple stock has underperformed so far in 2024. Investors appear concerned about slowing iPhone sales in China and regulatory headwinds. But none of these obstacles impact Apple\\'s ability to deliver growth and reward shareholders over the long term. Apple was still Berkshire Hathaway\\'s largest investment at the end of 2023, with a stake worth $174 billion. Buffett said a year ago that Apple was a better business than any Berkshire owned -- a significant statement, considering the incredible returns Berkshire has delivered over the years. The dip is a good buying opportunity ahead of a potentially strong growth period for Apple. The company is reportedly spending up to $1 billion per year on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology. It is widely speculated that Apple may release new AI features for its iOS software as early as this year. Over the next decade, AI could be game-changing for the customer experience, including potential implementation in AppleCare and Apple\\'s productivity apps like Pages and Numbers. Apple has all the cash it needs to continue improving its products. The company generated $107 billion in free cash flow over the last year, and it will keep growing as it sells more devices around the world. Apple\\'s installed base of active devices continues to hit new highs, now over 2.2 billion. While market participants focus on weak iPhone sales in China, Apple is still on the move everywhere else. This homebuilder still looks promising Jeremy Bowman (Lennar): Berkshire Hathaway surprised investors last year by going long on homebuilder stocks. Buffett (through Berkshire) purchased D.R. Horton, NVR, and Lennar. The conglomerate has since sold D.R. Horton, the country\\'s largest homebuilder, but it still retains small positions in Lennar and NVR. While both of those stocks are worth buying, Lennar is cheaper than NVR and is more similar to D.R. Horton, which just reported a strong quarterly earnings report, showing that demand for new homes remains strong, and profits continue to flow into the sector. We won\\'t get another quarterly update from Lennar until June, but the company looks to be in a good position to benefit from the same trends, including elevated interest trades, a lack of inventory in existing homes, and an estimated housing shortage of 4 million due to restrictive zoning laws and years of chronic underbuilding. Those factors have all contributed to elevated home prices, which is also a boon for homebuilders like Lennar. In its first-quarter earnings report, Lennar reported 12.6% revenue growth, which drove earnings up 21% to $719 million, and earnings per share rose 25% to $2.57 as management has taken advantage of the low stock price to buy back stock. Over the last year, the company has reduced shares outstanding by about 3.5%. Lennar also reported growth in all four of its regions, showing broad-based demand and execution. New orders increased 28% to 18,176 homes, showing healthy and growing demand. With interest rates now expected to remain \"higher for longer,\" Lennar is in a good position to capitalize on the housing crunch and macro environment, and the stock looks cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 11. Lennar looks like a good bet to move higher as it capitalizes on the demand for new homes. Buffett\\'s bet was late, but still profitable Jennifer Saibil (Amazon): Buffett isn\\'t known for buying technology stocks, and he acknowledged that he was late to the game when Berkshire finally invested in Amazon in 2019, 20 years after it became a public company. Amazon had already minted millionaires, but that didn\\'t deter Buffett from buying at that point. Buffett is all about patient investing, and he preferred to buy Amazon once it had a proven track record and strong profits while still offering tremendous opportunities. Buffett didn\\'t buy Amazon for exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), and he probably wouldn\\'t buy stocks today just to benefit from emerging trends. That might be part of the lesson in Buffett\\'s investing approach: When you buy stock in great companies, you\\'ll end up winning from these kinds of future opportunities, which Amazon has in abundance. Amazon is the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales, but its growth story still looks incredibly compelling. It\\'s the largest e-commerce company in the U.S. by a wide margin, and e-commerce is growing faster than overall retail. It has made structural changes to its e-commerce infrastructure that speed up deliveries at lower costs, and that should enhance its dominant position as well as pad profitability. Amazon is also the leading cloud services provider, and its AI tools for code developers and Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients reinforce its lead against a growing cadre of competitors. Amazon is investing in this groundbreaking technology, and it has a long, open runway in this growth story. Digital advertising has become Amazon\\'s fastest-growing segment, and this high-margin business is another lever it\\'s pushing to increase sales. Its AI tools for advertisers, as well as the ability for advertisers to reach customers as they shop, make Amazon a no-brainer platform for ads. Growth stocks tend to perform well in bull markets, and Amazon is already up 75% over the past year.

With FAANG stocks skyrocketing in 2023, you might think representatives and senators loaded up on the widely followed growth stocks. But that wasn\\'t the case. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill were net buyers of only one FAANG stock last year. The Apple of politicians\\' eyes Apple (AAPL -1.92%) turned out to win the votes of politicians in 2023. Representatives and senators bought $2.4 million of the tech stock, enough to land it in the No. 2 spot, narrowly trailing ConocoPhillips. Apple also ranked fifth among stocks traded by members of Congress based on number of shares. Twenty lawmakers traded Apple last year. This made the stock slightly less popular than Microsoft and JPMorgan Chase with 23 and 21 members of Congress trading each stock, respectively. Apple buyers on Capitol Hill included Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and the most active trader by far among members of Congress. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, another California Democrat, also aggressively scooped up shares of the iPhone maker. The stock wasn\\'t just attractive to Democrats, though. Republican representatives Dan Newhouse of Washington, Blake Moore of Utah, and Michael Guest of Mississippi bought Apple. So did GOP senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma. Why just Apple? It makes sense that Apple was a top pick for lawmakers -- it was the biggest company in the world based on market cap in 2023 and has been one of the most popular stocks among all investors for years. What is surprising, though, is that Apple was the only FAANG stock for which members of Congress were net buyers. Facebook parent Meta Platforms generated much greater returns last year than Apple, with the social media stock nearly tripling. But politicians didn\\'t jump on the bandwagon for some reason. Amazon, Netflix , and Google parent Alphabet also outperformed Apple. Again, representatives and senators weren\\'t excited enough about these stocks to aggressively buy them. Perhaps politicians suffered from recency bias: the tendency to place more emphasis on recent experiences. In 2022, all of the FAANG stocks plunged. However, Apple fell much less than any of the others. META data by YCharts. Is Apple stock a smart pick now? So far in 2024, members of Congress are selling Apple stock much more than buying it. But is it a smart pick now? There are reasons to be skeptical about the stock. Apple\\'s growth is lackluster. The company\\'s revenue rose by only 2% year over year in its quarter ending Dec. 30, 2023. That\\'s not enough growth to justify the stock\\'s valuation (shares currently trade at a forward earnings multiple of 25.6). Rumors are flying that the early sales of Apple\\'s new Vision Pro mixed-reality headset are disappointing. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote, \"Apple cut orders before launching Vision Pro in non-U.S. markets, which means that demand in the U.S. market has fallen sharply beyond expectations.\" On the other hand, Apple is expected to soon reveal new artificial intelligence (AI) innovations. CEO Tim Cook has hinted at a major announcement about AI this year. Cook said at the annual shareholder meeting in February that the company would \"break new ground\" in generative AI. Perhaps Apple\\'s AI news will disappoint investors. It\\'s possible, though, that new AI technology could set the stage for a \"supercycle\" of iPhone upgrades. If so, investors -- including members of Congress -- could be better off buying Apple than kicking the stock to the curb.

Buy This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock By Daniel Foelber – Apr 27, 2024 at 5:15AM Key Points During a stock market downturn, Investors tend to gravitate toward companies with reasonable valuations. Apple has a unique blend of qualities that separates it from other big tech companies. Apple is the kind of stock you can confidently buy even when other investors are fearful. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,961B Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-1.92%) -$3.77 Current Price $193.12 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET Apple has what it takes to persevere through a stock market correction. April has not been kind to the broader stock market this year, with the S&P 500 down 5.5% between April 1 and April 19. Granted, the index is still up on the year, but with many stocks still trading at high multiples, some investors may be concerned about further downward pressure. If you\\'re worried about a stock market sell-off, you may not exactly be looking at what stocks to buy. After all, isn\\'t that counterintuitive? However, stock market corrections, and especially bear markets, have historically been phenomenal buying opportunities for patient investors. Here\\'s why Apple (AAPL -1.92%) is an excellent blue chip stock to buy now, even if the market continues selling off. Image source: Getty Images. A not-so-magnificent year for Apple stock Apple is part of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a term coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. While most of the Magnificent Seven (especially Nvidia and Meta) have done well so far this year, Apple is within just a couple of percentage points of its 52-week low and is down over 14% year to date. Apple has underperformed for a long period, especially relative to the rest of the tech sector. Apple is the perfect value play Apple\\'s underperformance hasn\\'t been ideal for investors, but it does look good if the broader market continues selling off. During periods of market expansion, investors tend to be more forward-looking and reward companies with an attractive growth trajectory. But during a correction, investors can get defensive and look for companies that can put up solid earnings right now, pay dividends, and have a reasonable valuation. Apple\\'s growth has slowed, and it has yet to make a splash in artificial intelligence (AI) -- although future iPhones may increasingly rely on AI chips. But what Apple has going for it is a reasonable valuation -- with a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7 compared to 27 for the S&P 500. The quality of Apple\\'s earnings is also relatively high. There\\'s no denying that Apple relies on healthy consumer spending for product upgrades and increased service sales. However, its business has a high floor in that economic growth could slow or there could even be a recession, and Apple would probably not face nearly as severe of a downturn in its performance as more cyclical companies like Nvidia or Tesla. So it\\'s not just Apple\\'s valuation based on its trailing earnings that makes it a good value, but the nature of the business model and Apple\\'s ability to deliver results throughout the economic cycle. Apple also has a massive capital return program. Over the past five fiscal years, it has spent a staggering $391.5 billion on buybacks and $72.5 billion on dividends. Metric Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Stock Buybacks $66.1 billion $72.4 billion $86 billion $89.4 billion $77.6 billion Total Dividends Paid $14.1 billion $14.1 billion $14.5 billion $14.8 billion $15 billion Data Source: YCharts. Apple\\'s buyback program provides a nice cushion if the stock falls. Apple has the cash to step in and buy its stock, thereby reducing the share count and giving existing shareholders greater ownership of the company. The dividend is an additional incentive to hold the stock through volatile periods. Granted, it only yields 0.6%, but it\\'s still a massive capital commitment for Apple to its shareholders. Apple is sitting on a stockpile of cash Another attribute that gives Apple an extra layer of insulation from unforeseen challenges is its financial health. AAPL Net Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) data by YCharts Apple doesn\\'t rely on leverage to operate its business. It also has a massive stash of cash, equivalents, and current and non-current marketable securities. As of the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Apple\\'s trove of these assets was $172.6 billion, while its term debt was $106 billion. Therefore, Apple\\'s true \"cash position\" is even better than its leverage ratios would indicate. Investing through periods of volatility Apple has the brand, industry-leading position, valuation, capital return program, and balance sheet to provide the fundamentals needed to cushion the stock during a downturn. That\\'s not to say that Apple is impervious to downturns, but it does have more of a value bent than other Magnificent Seven stocks. Now would be a good time to take a moment to make sure you are confident in your portfolio to endure volatility, as well as make a list of companies that you like and could confidently buy even when asset prices are falling all around you. The ability to not just hold stocks but continue to put new capital into the market opens the door to compound wealth over time. Apple\\'s rock-solid fundamentals make it the perfect stock to buy now, especially if the market continues to sell off. Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Learn More After Apple Stock Has Skyrocketed 527%, Why Does Warren Buffett Still Own It? By Neil Patel – Apr 27, 2024 at 4:24AM Key Points Warren Buffett certainly appreciates companies that he can own forever, avoiding a hefty tax bill in the process. By staying put, Berkshire ends up owning more of Apple’s equity due to consistent share buybacks. Exiting the Apple position would only add to Berkshire’s already massive cash pile. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,961B Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-1.92%) -$3.77 Current Price $193.12 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET Apple has turned into a fantastic investment for Buffett\\'s Berkshire Hathaway. It\\'s not a surprise that most investors closely follow Warren Buffett. Based on his track record managing Berkshire Hathaway, he\\'s arguably the greatest capital allocator ever. The Oracle of Omaha has owned many stocks over the years, but none has moved the needle quite like Apple (AAPL -1.92%). Berkshire first purchased shares in the first quarter of 2016. From the start of that year to right now, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has skyrocketed 527% (as of April 19). It makes up 41% of the conglomerate\\'s portfolio. Apple\\'s market cap is a whopping $2.6 trillion, and after such a remarkable performance, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7. This makes you wonder why Buffett still owns shares. After giving it some thought, I believe there are four reasons why. Forever stock The first possible reason that Buffett remains a shareholder is because his favorable holding period is forever. He hasn\\'t even owned Apple stock for a decade yet, but this dominant business possesses traits that could make it a forever stock. It has arguably the strongest brand on Earth, so it benefits from pricing power, with consumers willing to pay expensive prices for its hardware devices. The combination of its products with services creates an incredibly powerful ecosystem. And Apple produces insane amounts of free cash flow. Because Berkshire isn\\'t selling off a sizable chunk of its shares, Buffett can be sure that his firm isn\\'t left paying a huge tax bill. This way, compounding can continue working its magic. High returns Another less obvious reason Buffett is still an Apple investor is simple because he believes the stock is going to continue generating market-beating returns over the long term, which is exactly what it has done in the past. Over long periods of time, the S&P 500 produces an average annual return of about 10%, including dividends. Maybe Buffett thinks Apple has the chance to do even better than this widely followed index. If so, then there\\'s clearly no point in exiting the investment. Capital allocation As of this writing, Berkshire Hathaway owns 906 million shares of Apple, giving the conglomerate a 5.9% stake in the tech giant. Apple\\'s beneficial capital allocation policies provide a massive benefit to Buffett\\'s firm. After a nearly two-decade pause, the iPhone maker has paid a dividend since 2012. Its quarterly payout these days is $0.24, which translates to an unexciting yield of 0.58%. However, for Berkshire this means $870 million in passive annual income. That\\'s a nice financial windfall. Apple is very keen on executing share repurchases. In the past three fiscal years, the outstanding share count has been reduced by 9%. If Buffett just stays put, his company\\'s equity ownership will rise over time. Cash pile As outside observers, we really have no idea what\\'s going on in Warren Buffett\\'s head. All we can do is try and come up with explanations for his investment decisions based on the public information there is. One piece of info we know is that Berkshire had $168 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills on the balance sheet at the end of last year. This is the case because there aren\\'t attractive buying opportunities that are also big enough to move the needle. If Buffett decided that he wanted to sell all his Apple shares, what would Berkshire do with the $149 billion in pre-tax proceeds (at Apple\\'s price of $165 per share on April 19)? This would only exacerbate the current problem. Despite Apple\\'s massive size and expensive valuation, perhaps Buffett simply believes the stock provides a better expected return than holding cash.

Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Market Cap $853B Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (2.29%) $3.77 Current Price $168.16 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET TSMC may be dealing with cyclical issues, but its long-term value remains strong as the clear leader in chip production. It doesn\\'t take much looking around to see the digital transformation the world is to undergoing. Smartphones are glued to people\\'s hands, electric cars are increasingly appearing, and there\\'s no shortage of gadgets to \"smartify\" homes. Even wilder is that much of this has happened in the past couple of decades. Behind many of these electronics that now seem inescapable are semiconductor chips, which power them. Unfortunately, shortage issues started during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have continued. Despite these challenges, investors with a longer timeframe can invest in one of tech\\'s most important businesses: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM 2.29%), or TSMC. Your favorite tech company\\'s favorite chip supplier Part of what established TSMC as the global chip leader is the foundry model it pioneered. TSMC doesn\\'t make chips that people or companies can buy online or at a retail store like typical electronics. Instead, the company makes chips designed for other companies\\' specific needs. It\\'s like ordering custom-tailored clothing instead of buying something off the rack. Many global leaders depend on TSMC\\'s chips for their operations. Apple uses it for its iPhones, Nvidia uses it for its graphic processing units (GPUs), and Sony uses it for its game consoles. Being able to handle customers\\' demands on a large scale has given TSMC a competitive advantage because its chips are industry-leading, and it\\'s not easy for companies to switch between chip manufacturers. Check out TSMC\\'s key financial growth TSMC\\'s revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was just over $18.8 billion, but was met with mixed reactions. On the positive side, it was up 12.9% year over year (YOY); on the negative side, it was down 3.8% from the previous quarter. Net income followed a similar trend, up YOY but down from the previous quarter. Despite the drops from the previous quarter, it\\'s important to examine TSMC\\'s revenue and net income progress, especially over the last five years. TSM Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts The quarter-to-quarter drop can be attributed to the seasonality of smartphone sales. Smartphone sales and production ramp up in the fourth quarter because many people purchase them for the holidays, so it\\'s no shock that Q1 is slowing down from Q4. The bigger focus should be on the longer-term growth of those two key financial metrics. Investors should weather the smartphone sales slump storm When TSMC announced its Q1 earnings, investors didn\\'t seem too pleased, and the stock dropped 3% in a day. The displeasure didn\\'t stem from its revenue and net income growth (or decline if you\\'re looking quarter to quarter), but more from the outlook of smartphone sales. Smartphone sales accounted for 38% of TSMC\\'s revenue in the first quarter, compared to 43% in the previous quarter. This drop reflects the seasonality of smartphone sales and the overall slump being experienced industrywide. Smartphone sales have been down for a while, and on its recent earnings call, TSMC\\'s CEO noted the recovery will likely continue to be gradual. TSMC\\'s growth will rely heavily on smartphone sales returning to more stable levels because they account for a significant portion of its revenue, but this doesn\\'t strike me as a long-term problem that changes TSMC\\'s value proposition. If anything, the news about smartphones caused investors to overreact and overshadowed the growth of other areas of TSMC\\'s business. Source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\\'s 2024 first quarter presentation. TSMC\\'s place in the tech ecosystem gives it longevity Regardless of how investors feel about the current state of TSMC\\'s business, there\\'s no denying how important it is to the entire tech ecosystem. Without TSMC and its advanced chips, there\\'s a strong case that plenty of tech companies and their electronics wouldn\\'t perform at their current levels. What sets TSMC apart from other chipmakers is the end stages of chip production and a process called \"packaging,\" which involves enclosing the chip and putting in electrical connections critical for the chip\\'s ability to function in different electronics. All chip makers use the packaging process, but TSMC has a long list of patents (around 3,000) protecting its advanced chip-packaging technology. This technology allows TSMC to essentially stack and combine several chip components into a single item, leading to much higher performance than other chips. This creates a competitive moat that other chipmakers likely won\\'t breach at any time in the foreseeable future. Stefon Walters has positions in Apple.

Learn More Fiverr Is My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Now. Here\\'s Why. By Anders Bylund – Apr 27, 2024 at 3:37AM Key Points Fiverr\\'s stock is trading near its all-time low, even as the business enjoys profitable growth. Fiverr has outperformed tech giants like Apple and Microsoft in recent years on revenue growth. Some see generative AI as a game-changing threat to Fiverr, but the AI boom is actually proving valuable for its business. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: FVRR Fiverr International Market Cap $954M Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.45%) $0.11 Current Price $24.64 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET The freelance services marketplace\\'s stock has taken a beating in the last three years, but the business just kept growing. It\\'s easy to find artificial intelligence (AI) stocks nowadays. Any tech company worth its silicon salt is at least dabbling in basic machine learning and generative AI. Those that don\\'t offer AI tools of their own are putting computers to work on a whole new level. Close your eyes and point at a spot on a map of the Santa Clara Valley, and you\\'ll probably find six AI start-ups sharing a PO box. But not every AI company can be a winner, and many of today\\'s aspiring experts will wind up busts in the long run. And even the proven technology winners can become overvalued, with most of their long-term growth prospects already priced into their stocks. And that\\'s why I get downright excited when I find an actual AI player with an underpriced stock. That\\'s a rare breed indeed. So let me tell you why I can\\'t stop buying shares of Fiverr International (FVRR 0.45%). Why is Fiverr\\'s stock so cheap? Some folks think that the rise of AI tools will be the death of Fiverr\\'s creative and professional freelance services -- and wasn\\'t remote work supposed to fade out at the end of the pandemic anyway? The one-two punch of these pessimistic views has driven Fiverr\\'s stock down to the basement, and through a trapdoor in the foundation. At the bottom of that hole, Fiverr shares only found a shovel and clear instructions to keep digging. The stock now sits less than 9% above its (recently notched) all-time low and roughly 94% below the record high it set in early 2021. How is the actual business doing, though? It\\'s true that Fiverr\\'s revenue growth slowed down in 2022. Freelance service buyers of every stripe slowed down their spending as inflation surged, and Fiverr took a hit like many other businesses. But its slowdown looks mild in the context of what befell other tech stocks in the same period. In fact, Fiverr\\'s business growth over the last three years made Apple (AAPL -1.92%) and Microsoft (MSFT 0.95%) look sluggish. FVRR Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Maybe you\\'d rather compare free cash flow instead of top-line growth. That\\'s cool, because Fiverr walks away with that trophy too. FVRR Free Cash Flow data by YCharts. Fiverr is a bargain-bin AI winner Sure, it\\'s a bit unfair to compare these companies on a percentage-growth basis. Fiverr is much smaller than the tech titans, and it\\'s much harder to nearly quintuple your free cash flow when that metric is scaled in the tens of billions of dollars rather than tens of millions. The law of large numbers strikes again. But that undeniable fact doesn\\'t take anything away from the fact that Fiverr is delivering proven growth and robust cash flows, long after many investors abandoned the former market darling. But what of the threat of OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT and other generative AI tools? Yes, Fiverr may lose a few freelance connections as penny-pinching clients look for ways to avoid paying for talent. But those cost-cutters will soon find out that it takes human brains to make the most of these tempting AI tools. As the old truism in the computing world states: Garbage in, garbage out. This helps explain why AI talent is one of Fiverr\\'s fastest-growing service categories these days. Service buyers need people who know how to make the most of those inherently uncreative machines. \"Overall, we estimate AI created a net positive impact of 4% to our business in 2023 as we see a category mix shift from simple services such as translation and voice-over to more complex services such as mobile app development, e-commerce management, or financial consulting,\" CEO Micha Kaufman said in February\\'s fourth-quarter earnings call. \"In 2023, complex services represented nearly one-third of our market base, a significant step-up from 2022.\" There you have it. Fiverr benefits directly from the generative AI race, its business growth is back on track after a temporary slowdown, and the company never stopped collecting cash profits hand over fist. But the stock is priced for absolute disaster. That\\'s a big mistake, which is why Fiverr is first on my list every time I have fresh cash to invest. You should take a closer look at this price-to-value mismatch, and perhaps follow my lead. It\\'s hard to find a wealth-building bargain like Fiverr.

Learn More 3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Billionaires Jim Simons, Ray Dalio, and Israel Englander Are Buying By Jeremy Bowman – Apr 27, 2024 at 3:05AM Key Points Nvidia shares have soared thanks to its leadership in AI GPUs. Meta has also been a winner as its ad business has bounced back. Alphabet has attracted hedge fund investors with its strong set of competitive advantages. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: NVDA Nvidia Market Cap $300B Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.75%) $0.90 Current Price $121.79 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET These top investors are big backers of the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Jim Simons, Ray Dalio, and Israel Englander are some of the most successful investors in history. All three are billionaires, and their respective hedge funds -- Renaissance Technologies, Bridgewater Associates, and Millennium Management -- have made thousands of investors rich along with them. In investing, there are no bonus points for originality, so it pays to study the masters. In fact, thanks to the 13F filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) every quarter, you can invest alongside these billionaires as well. According to Motley Fool Research, these investors all own three of the same \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. Keep reading to see what they are and if these stocks are right for you. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Nvidia It\\'s probably not a surprise to see Nvidia (NVDA 0.75%) on this list. More than any other company, Nvidia has been the flag bearer of the AI boom as its sales and profits skyrocketed over the last year, propelling the stock past a $2 trillion market cap, and making it the third-most valuable company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia\\'s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, and the company has faced little competition thus far, though competition is coming. Simons, Dalio, and Englander all count Nvidia among their top holdings. At Renaissance Technologies, Nvidia is the second-largest tech holding, making up 1.2% of the portfolio, or $767.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Dalio\\'s Bridgewater Associates, meanwhile, counts Nvidia as its third-largest tech holding with $133 million in Nvidia stock at the end of Q4. The fast-growing chip stock made up 0.7% of Bridgewater\\'s portfolio. Finally, Nvidia makes up the fourth-largest tech holding in Englander\\'s Millennium Management at 1% of the portfolio, or $1.02 billion. It\\'s unclear if these funds held, added to, or sold Nvidia in Q1, but we\\'ll learn soon as 13F filings are due by mid-May. If they hold on to their Nvidia stakes, that move paid off as the stock jumped 82% in Q1. 2. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (META 1.96%) is another top holding of these hedge funds, and like Nvidia, it\\'s soared over the last year and a half. While Meta has benefited from the AI boom, the primary reason for its surge is a successful turnaround driven by cost cutting and a resurgence in its ad business that led to record profits. Looking ahead, the company still seems to have plenty of growth in front of it, especially with the new opportunity in AI, though some advertisers have recently complained that the company\\'s ad manager has been unreliable. At Renaissance, Meta represents the fund\\'s fourth-largest holding in the tech sector with $744 million worth of Meta stock. Meta makes up 1.2% of the fund\\'s value. Ray Dalio\\'s Bridgewater, meanwhile, is even more bullish on Meta as the social media giant makes up 1.3% of its portfolio as its second-biggest tech holding. The fund finished Q4 with $235.8 million worth of Meta stock. Lastly, Millennium held $719.7 million in Meta stock as of the end of Q4, or 0.7% of the portfolio. That made it its fifth-largest tech holding. 3. Alphabet Finally, Alphabet (GOOG 0.50%) (GOOGL 0.43%) has long been a top stock among hedge funds as the Google parent\\'s competitive advantages are manifest with its dominant search engine, properties like YouTube, and promising \"moonshot\" businesses like its Waymo autonomous vehicle unit, and its AI investments like Google Brain and DeepMind. Alphabet hasn\\'t had the kind of blowout performance over the past year that Nvidia and Meta have, but it\\'s still outperformed the S&P 500 and recently touched an all-time high. Given its history of reliable growth and wide economic moat, it\\'s not surprising that Alphabet is also a top pick among these three funds. At Renaissance, Alphabet was its sixth-largest tech holding, worth $487.2 million, or 0.8% of the total portfolio. Bridgewater was more bullish on Alphabet than any other tech stock, counting it as its top-tech holding at 1.6% of the total portfolio. As of the end of Q4, Bridgewater owned $285.6 million worth of Alphabet stock. Millennium also counts Alphabet as a top holding as the Google owner\\'s stock makes up 1.8%, or $1.56 billion. Only Microsoft is a larger tech holding at Englander\\'s fund. What it means for investors Hedge fund ownership isn\\'t a guarantee of outperformance, but it\\'s worth tracking the moves of the biggest investors, especially if their holdings are similar to yours. Keep your eye on these stocks come mid-May as they could move once we learn which funds bought and sold them in Q1. Nonetheless, I\\'d expect them to remain top holdings among the biggest hedge funds.

Learn More 2 Stocks Down 21% and 34% to Buy Right Now By Scott Levine and Lee Samaha – Apr 27, 2024 at 3:03AM Key Points The machine vision market is set for long-term growth even if it\\'s going through a period of temporary weakness. Brookfield Renewable\\'s high-yield distribution is ripe for the picking right now after the company\\'s strong 2023 performance. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: BEPC Brookfield Renewable Market Cap $11B Today\\'s Change Arrow-Thin-Down (4.09%) $1.24 Current Price $31.58 Price as of June 10, 2024, 4:00 p.m. ET These two leading stocks may be down, but they\\'re by no means out. Soaring nearly 20% since this time last year, the S&P 500 has powered higher and higher, providing an even better return than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has climbed about 7%. But not every stock has enjoyed such an impressive run this past year. In fact, two quality stocks, Cognex (CGNX 1.04%) and Brookfield Renewable (BEPC 4.09%), have headed in the other direction, falling 21% and 34% over the last year, respectively. Let\\'s see why two fool.com contributors think the stocks are buys despite their recent declines. Cognex\\'s best days lie ahead Lee Samaha (Cognex): Cognex stock is down 4% this year and 18.6% over the last 12 months. It\\'s not hard to see why. The machine vision technology company\\'s three primary end markets have all struggled recently. Its logistics end market (e-commerce warehousing) slowed last year as companies like Amazon slowed investment after a few years of heavy investment driven by the pandemic. In addition, its consumer electronics end market (Apple is a Cognex customer) also slowed as smartphone and other electronics sales slowed, partly due to a correction from strong spending on consumer products during the pandemic and rising interest rates pressuring consumer spending. It\\'s a similar story with the automotive industry, whereby rising rates slow automotive sales and production. It\\'s a story of near-term weakness, and it wouldn\\'t be surprising if there were more near-term pressure coming when the company reports its first-quarter earnings in early May. That said, this is a temporary weakness in a long-term growth story. Consumer electronics companies, including Apple, can only stay relevant by investing in new product development. That means more investment in production lines and machine vision technology that helps monitor and guide processes like aligning mobile phone screens. Similarly, automotive companies must invest in electric vehicles to stay ahead of the competition. E-commerce growth isn\\'t going away anytime soon, even if the growth rate has tempered after the pandemic. As such, spending on e-commerce warehousing will grow again over time. Cognex will see better days. The company has always had a bumpy growth trajectory, and its history suggests its growth recovery could be robust when it occurs. Its solutions add value to manufacturing and logistics activity and are part of the movement toward automated production. All told, it usually makes sense to be greedy about buying a growth stock when the market is fearful and fretting about near-term weakness. Brookfield Renewable will make your passive income stream pop Scott Levine (Brookfield Renewable): Unlike the situation with Cognex, the catalyst behind Brookfield Renewable\\'s tumbling stock is less clear. While the company itself has performed well, shares of Brookfield Renewable have plunged 34% since this time last year and 22% since the start of 2024. Despite the market souring on the stock, the investing thesis remains strong, and it remains a particularly appealing option for those looking to fortify their passive income with its ultra-high forward-yielding 6.4% stock. Characterizing 2023 as a \"record year for our business on almost all metrics,\" Connor Teskey, Brookfield Renewable\\'s CEO, lauded the company\\'s performance in its fourth-quarter 2023 earnings report. The clean energy powerhouse, for example, set a high-water mark for funds from operations (FFO), reporting $1.1 billion -- a 9% year-over-year increase. And it\\'s not only the company\\'s recent performance that is encouraging. Brookfield Renewable seems poised for continued growth, ending 2023 with projects totaling almost 24 gigawatts (GW) in the advanced stage of development. The company\\'s strong FFO growth contributes to the argument that Brookfield Renewable\\'s dividend isn\\'t at risk of being cut. Skeptics often balk at high-yield dividend stocks, fretting that the high payouts might not be sustainable, but the company\\'s strong cash-flow generation suggests otherwise. In 2023 and 2022, Brookfield Renewable had FFO payout ratios of 80% and 84%, respectively. Pair this with the company\\'s investment-grade balance sheet, and it seems that skeptics can rest assured that the dividend isn\\'t likely to be slashed anytime soon. Even more reassurance that Brookfield Renewable is a solid passive income play comes from the company\\'s outlook. Targeting consistent 5% to 9% annual distribution increases, management projects 10% growth in FFO per unit from 2023 to 2028. Of course, there\\'s no guarantee that the company will succeed in achieving these targets, but the company\\'s track record of increasing its distribution at a 6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 20 years and increasing its FFO at a 12% CAGR from 2016 through 2023 are encouraging signs. Is now the time for you to click the buy button on these two beaten-down stocks? Smart investors know that just because the market has punished a stock, it doesn\\'t mean that the punishment has been warranted. Both Cognex and Brookfield Renewable have seen their stocks tumble recently, but the declines don\\'t suggest that investors should keep their distance. For growth investors looking to grab a great growth stock, Cognex is certainly worthy of consideration, while income investors will want to dig deeper into powering their portfolios with Brookfield Renewable.

AAPL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, and Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, reported CNBC on Friday.He also spoke about the importance of the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and the employment figures from the Department of Labor on Friday.The Mad Money host expressed his concerns about the economy, stating, “We have to run such a ridiculous gauntlet next week that I have no idea how it'll play out.” Adding, “But I do think the economy's getting weaker — I just hope the Federal Reserve has noticed.”Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.On Monday, SoFi and Domino’s Pizza will report their earnings. Tuesday will see reports from Eli Lilly, McDonald’s, Amazon, and Starbucks. Wednesday will feature reports from CVS, Pfizer, Wingstop, Carvana, and Marriott, as well as the Fed’s rate announcement.Cramer said Eli Lilly’s outcomes will offer clarity on the sales performance of the company’s weight loss and diabetes drug, along with further details on the potential approval timeline for its Alzheimer’s treatment by the Food and Drug Administration.On Thursday, Apple is set to release its report, with Cramer highlighting significant investor skepticism toward the Big Tech firm.

       " '**Summary:**\\n\\nThe article discusses the recent sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite, particularly in the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, including Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA).
