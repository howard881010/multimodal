Moderate to heavy rainfall is likely in the southeastern U.S. over the weekend, while plowable snow is expected in the northern regions.

Below normal high temperatures (10-15째F below) are expected in the West, while the southern and eastern regions will see near to above normal temperatures, particularly warmer morning lows. Significant snowfall, ice, and freezing rain risks are forecast for the Northern Plains, Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast.
